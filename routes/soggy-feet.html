            is where you'll unload for this route. Take in the river and listen to the water rush over the falls
            just below before you head off. Beware, there's no bathroom's in sight, so take care of that before
            or once your deep in the Piedmont Wildlife Management Area. There's a couple of picnic tables for
            smashing your post ride food, so be sure to pack something to enjoy.

            Head over the bridge and through a small neighborhood and you're on the gravel. You'll remain
            there for 95% of your ride. Except for the four creek crossings, which is how this ride got it's name. Three of
            the creeks are crossable on gravel bikes, leaving one you have to get creative on. Toss your shoes
            over, walk through it, or <i>attempt</i> to ride through it... either way, you've got to make it to
            the other side.
          </p>
          <p>
            As you make your way through the Peidmont Wildlife Management Area
            you'll roll over various kinds of gravel. Some fine silky roads and some that are a little more
            chunky, making the decents feel like your floating. You'll encounter no homes once
            you're in the green zone, so make sure you're prepared with a tube or two and snacks. It's about
            as peaceful as you can get.
          </p>
          <p>
            Rolling back over the bridge you'll be thinking about taking dip in the river before heading
            back to civilization... or maybe you'll be regretting you didn't attempt to bunny hop the smallest
            creek.
